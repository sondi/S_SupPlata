            <h3>Our Home Base</h3>
            <p>SUP Plata tours originate out of La Alejandria – a tropical paradise that is accessed on coastal highway #200 at KM 125 which is 15 minutes west of Puerto Escondido (8 minutes west of the Puerto Escondido airport).  This lush location has food service, alcoholic beverages, WIFI and is the storage site for our boards as well as the launching location. After a brief safety and information session, Jon will take you on your paddleboard tour.  After your tour, you can sit back and relax, have some food and a cold beer and enjoy the quiet ambience that La Alejandria has to offer.</p>

            <p>- Our stand-up paddle morning with Jon, Luz & Romina was amazing. The laguna is so peaceful and calm. We bird watched, swam and even did some yoga and tai chi poses! And a late breakfast on the shore at Alejandria's Restaurant was great as well. A must do when in the area! We'll be back for sure!
